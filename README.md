# 120 Day Data Analytics Challenge_Day
## Day 2 — Portfolio Review & Quality Criteria
Today’s focus was reviewing strong data analytics portfolios to understand what makes a project clear, credible, and engaging.

I reviewed two projects:

* Financial Credit Insights — This project stood out for its structure. It opened with a dashboard snapshot, followed by a clear project overview and a well-defined
  objective. The technical section flowed logically into DAX, insights, recommendations, and conclusions. The clarity of purpose made the project easy to follow from start
  to finish.
* Restaurant Order Analysis (SQL) — This project followed a similar pattern, starting with SQL queries and moving into business problems and key findings. The analysis
  stayed grounded in real questions rather than just query outputs.

Key takeaway from both reviews: strong portfolios prioritize structure, problem clarity, and storytelling over complexity. These projects weren’t generic—they were
intentional and focused on impact.

Next step: reviewing my own projects to ensure the objective, flow, and story are clear from the first glance.
